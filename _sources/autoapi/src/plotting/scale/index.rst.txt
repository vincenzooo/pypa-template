.. py:class:: Scale(pixsize=None, un='', visible=False)

   Bases: :py:obj:`object`

   2018/12/10 N.B.: this almost works, but scale is not accurate when zooming.
   probably something with how the length is rounded. use grid for comparison to
   see the effect.

   A scale that can be plotted as line and text.
   Can be turned on and off setting the `visible` property.
   .pixsize is the size of a pixel in the units used for the caption.
   The string from the unit is in self.un.
   The method draw draws the scale if self.visible is True and
   remove it if not. Instances of line and text are returned
   (and can be modified, remember to call plt.draw to apply changes).
   Note that scale is independent on image, so it is plotted on current
   axis, it is care of the caller to set that.
   The scale updates itself on the plot on zooming, through callback
   connection through ax.callbacks.connect

   .. py:method:: draw(self, ax=None, pixsize=None)

      from size of pixel pixsize (default to self.pixsize)
      and corresponding real size imsize calculate a a suitable size for a
      scale mark and the corresponding value and draw it.
      The text for the unit is provided in un.
      Note that only matplotlib objects are used, an image is not necessary
      and there are no pixels: pixsize represents the physical size of a unit of
      axis coordinate (it matches pixel size if an image is plotted with pixel
      coordinates, as default in imshow)


   .. py:method:: remove(self)



.. py:function:: test_with_image(infile, outfolder=None)

   apply a scale on a image. Image can be aligned and zoomed to verify scale
   and scale update.


.. py:function:: test_with_plot(outfolder=None)

   Apply scale to a line plot, it should work the same as an image.
