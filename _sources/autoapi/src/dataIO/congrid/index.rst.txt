.. py:function:: congrid(a, newdims, method='linear', centre=False, minusone=False)

   Arbitrary resampling of source array to new dimension sizes.
   Currently only supports maintaining the same number of dimensions.
   To use 1-D arrays, first promote them to shape (x,1).

   Uses the same parameters and creates the same co-ordinate lookup points
   as IDL''s congrid routine, which apparently originally came from a VAX/VMS
   routine of the same name.

   method:
   neighbour - closest value from original data
   nearest and linear - uses n x 1-D interpolations using
                        scipy.interpolate.interp1d
   (see Numerical Recipes for validity of use of n 1-D interpolations)
   spline - uses ndimage.map_coordinates

   centre:
   True - interpolation points are at the centres of the bins
   False - points are at the front edge of the bin

   minusone:
   For example- inarray.shape = (i,j) & new dimensions = (x,y)
   False - inarray is resampled by factors of (i/x) * (j/y)
   True - inarray is resampled by(i-1)/(x-1) * (j-1)/(y-1)
   This prevents extrapolation one element beyond bounds of input array.
