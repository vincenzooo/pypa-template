.. py:function:: readCylScript(fn, rotate=np.linspace(0.75, 1.5, 50), interp=None)

   Load in data from 4D measurement of cylindrical mirror.
   File is assumed to have been saved with Ryan's scripting function.
   Scale to microns, remove misalignments,
   strip NaNs.
   If rotate is set to an array of angles, the rotation angle
   which minimizes the number of NaNs in the image after
   stripping perimeter nans is selected.
   Distortion is bump positive looking at concave surface.
   Imshow will present distortion in proper orientation as if
   viewing the concave surface.


.. py:function:: readCyl4D(fn, rotate=np.linspace(0.75, 1.5, 50), interp=None)

   Load in data from 4D measurement of cylindrical mirror.
   Scale to microns, remove misalignments,
   strip NaNs.
   If rotate is set to an array of angles, the rotation angle
   which minimizes the number of NaNs in the image after
   stripping perimeter nans is selected.
   Distortion is bump positive looking at concave surface.
   Imshow will present distortion in proper orientation as if
   viewing the concave surface.


.. py:function:: readConic4D(fn, rotate=None, interp=None)

   Load in data from 4D measurement of cylindrical mirror.
   Scale to microns, remove misalignments,
   strip NaNs.
   If rotate is set to an array of angles, the rotation angle
   which minimizes the number of NaNs in the image after
   stripping perimeter nans is selected.
   Distortion is bump positive looking at concave surface.
   Imshow will present distortion in proper orientation as if
   viewing the concave surface.


.. py:function:: readFlatScript(fn, interp=None)

   Load in data from 4D measurement of flat mirror.
   File is assumed to have been saved with Ryan's scripting function.
   Scale to microns, remove misalignments,
   strip NaNs.
   Distortion is bump positive looking at surface from 4D.
   Imshow will present distortion in proper orientation as if
   viewing the surface.
