.. py:function:: fit_3D_plane(points, plot=False)

   Find best fit plane for points. Points is a Nx3 array.
   If a plane is defined by the equation a*x+b*y+c*z+d=0, then the normal has
   direction [a,b,c]. The plane is returned as a tuple (normal,ctr).
   Note that there is some ambiguity in the orientation of the normal. I believe it is related to the sign of d. Also some mistake in plot of normal.
